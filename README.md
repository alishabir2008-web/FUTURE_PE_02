#  AI Website Copy Generator for Local Businesses
This project showcases how structured prompt engineering can be used to generate clear, persuasive, and conversion-focused website copy for local businesses using AI.

Instead of writing website content manually, this system uses reusable AI prompts to produce high-quality copy that helps businesses attract customers and increase inquiries.
